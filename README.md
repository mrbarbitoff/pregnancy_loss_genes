# The landscape of point mutations in pregnancy loss

This repository contains data files and code used for the analysis presented in the paper:

Maksiutenko E.M., *et al*. (2023) The Landscape of Point Mutations in Human Protein Coding Genes Leading to Pregnancy Loss. *Int J Mol Sci*, 

`SAB_final_code.R` file contains all of the R code used for the analysis of pregnancy loss genes. The dataset (a list of all variants) is present in the `variant_full_list.txt`. 

Other files in the repository correspond to external data units used in the script. Please note that the BioGRID file is compressed to fit into the repository.
